# 🧠 Supabase Manager - Architecture Context (For AI & Maintainers)

This document is intended for AI coding assistants, open-source contributors, maintainers, and developers to rapidly understand the core architecture, design patterns, and context of the **Supabase Manager** project.

---

## 🏗 System Architecture Overview

This project is a monolithic **Next.js 15 (App Router)** application that serves both the aesthetically pleasing Frontend Dashboard and the intensive Backend API routes executing host system-level operations.

### Core Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: Next.js (React Server & Client Components), Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui components, Radix/Lucide icons, Recharts for monitoring gauges.
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes (Node.js runtime environment). 
- **Database**: SQLite3 (`management.db`) for storing admin credentials, project configurations (Web Hosting), and user settings.
- **Real-time Server**: Custom Node.js HTTP Server running **Socket.io** alongside Next.js to broadcast real-time events (handling the Web Terminal emulator sessions).
- **Process Manager**: PM2 for daemonizing the production application and ensuring uptime.

## 🛡 Security & Authentication Flow (SQLite + JWT)

The security of this application centers around preventing unauthorized access to the massive system-level APIs it controls.

1. **Pre-Seeded Database**: When the server boots and loads `src/lib/db.ts`, it automatically attempts to create `.sqlite` tables (`users`, `settings`, `hosting_projects`). If empty, an admin user (`admin` / `admin`) is generated and hashed via SHA-256. 
2. **Login Attempt**: User logs in via `/login` -> hits `/api/auth/login`. Verified against the SQLite `users` table.
3. **Session Cookie**: If valid, an **HTTP-only, Lax JWT Cookie (`session`)** is crafted using `jose` with `HS256` lasting 7 days.
4. **Middleware Protection**: `src/middleware.ts` intercepts **EVERY request** going to `/dashboard/*` and `/api/*` (excluding `/api/auth`).
5. **API Bypass keys (Cron Jobs)**: Background daemons or `curl` calls can bypass JWT protection by sending an `x-api-key` header mapped strictly to the `.env`'s `CRON_SECRET`.

## ⚙️ Primary Functional Modules

### 1. Web Hosting & NGINX Automator (The Self-Hosted Vercel equivalent)
- **Database**: Tracks project names, domains, and GitHub repository links in SQLite.
- **Deploy Trigger**: `/api/hosting/deploy` connects to GitHub's raw API (with Optional Auth for Private Repos), downloads `.tar.gz` payload of a tagged release, extracts it natively using `tar --strip-components=1`, and plops it directly into the mapped destination web folder root.
- **NGINX Symlink Generator**: Creates standard SPA routing configurations and saves them temporarily to `/tmp/project.conf`. The generator embeds a global `include snippets/supabase-proxy.conf;` directive explicitly mapping Supabase APIs (Auth, Rest, Realtime, Storage, Functions, Vector) silently under standard ports (80/443).
- **Execution**: For strict security, the Host OS does NOT execute `sudo mv` autonomously anymore. Instead, it returns the generated commands arrays back to the Next.js Frontend UI (`/dashboard/hosting`), instructing the user to paste them in the terminal manually.

### 2. Auto-Update via GitHub CI/CD Pipeline
- **Continuous Integration**: When a developer tags a commit on GitHub, `release.yml` naturally creates an application bundle `build.tar.gz`.
- **System Action**: `/api/system/update` allows the dashboard UI to pull down its own latest build, unpack it entirely over the operating tree, runs `npm install --omit=dev` to bind fresh native drivers like `sqlite3` natively to the host OS C++ libraries, and systematically signals `pm2 reload` to restart itself.

### 3. Docker Module (`dockerode`) & Volume Control
Located in `/api/docker`. Relies strictly on the UNIX socket `/var/run/docker.sock` to interface with the host daemon. It bypasses bash CLI entirely to provide real JSON responses for Container lifecycle states, memory usage, and precise Volumes mapping.
- **Container Inspector**: Exposes `container.inspect()` natively to allow fetching Environment Variables, Network configurations, and mapped Bind Mounts accurately mapping into the Frontend UI without manual bash querying.

### 4. Web Terminal Module (`node-pty` + `socket.io` + `xterm.js`)
- **Backend Component**: `server.js` overrides Next's native server initiation, instantiating `Socket.IO`. It spawns a raw bash binary locally via the `node-pty` native extension (pseudo-terminal). This ties the bash's raw output strictly to the websocket room.
- **Frontend Component**: `/dashboard/shell` uses `xterm.js` to render GUI interactive bash sessions natively.

### 5. Configs & File Manager Module (`/api/files`)
The goal of the File manager is to visually represent areas of the Host OS, constrained to a predefined environment for security.
- **Path Traversal Protection**: To mitigate directory traversal (`..` payload escapes), `/api/files/route.ts` runs a rigorous `resolveSafePath()` helper mapping back to `FILE_MANAGER_ROOT` in SQLite. Failure throws a hard 403.

### 6. Supabase Management & Edge Functions Deployer (`/api/supabase/*`)
Consolidates Supabase administration into a unified interface, tracking the base `SUPABASE_PROJECT_PATH`.
- **Component Controller**: Automates updating the `docker-compose.yml` image tags natively via regex replacements and executes standard pull/up operations seamlessly. Includes a web-based Monaco editor to safely rewrite `.env` without nano/vim.
- **Edge Functions Releases**: A dedicated sub-module acting as a CD (Continuous Deployment) listener. It utilizes a `SUPABASE_FUNCTIONS_PAT` stored securely in the database to ingest `functions.zip` assets remotely compiled on GitHub Private Repositories. It automatically unzips the binaries straight into the volume host mounts and orchestrates instantaneous `edge-runtime` container restarts.

### 7. Database Management Module (`/api/database/*` & `/dashboard/database`)
Provides a graphical and systematic approach to managing Supabase PostgreSQL schema migrations and seeds.
- **Artifact-Based Migrations**: Instead of scanning host directories randomly, it strictly fetches `database.zip` artifacts defined in GitHub Releases (mirroring the Functions approach). This allows for strict version control tying Database Schema directly to Function releases.
- **State Comparison**: It automatically joins local SQL filenames extracted from the zip with the live PostgreSQL `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` system table, visually determining which migrations are "Pending" or already "Applied".
- **Secure Encoding Execution**: Mitigates nasty Windows Docker Pipe encoding bugs (e.g. Thai character corruption) by exclusively relying on `docker cp` to transit SQL artifacts into the container runtime BEFORE executing them via `psql -f`. Includes Public Schema Dumps and Clear actions.

## 🧭 Roadmap / Known Missing Pieces (TODO)

- **Role Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Currently, only a single "Admin" tier exists via `id=1`. There is no concept of viewers vs. editors.
- **Localization (i18n)**: Expanding structural hooks for multiple language supports like Thai, Spanish, etc.
